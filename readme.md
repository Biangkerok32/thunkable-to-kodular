# Thunkable to Kodular AIA converter

Only working on Windows

How to use:
 1. Export your project on the latest version of Thunkable
 2. Put the exported AIA file in the same folder as the converter and drag it to tk2mk.cmd
 3. A new file called *_kodular.aia has been created
 4. Go to Kodular and import the new AIA file
 5. That's all. Don't hesitate to report an issue if something doesn't work.

Note: The [7z.exe](https://www.7-zip.org/) binary is included to simplify zip and unzip processes. If you want to use your own 7-Zip, uncomment all commented lines and remove the line above them.
