# Thunkable to Kodular AIA converter

**WARNING : The Python version currently creates an invalid AIA file for Kodular because of the new line format (CRLF instead of LF)**

How to use:
 1. Export your project on the latest version of Thunkable
 2. Drag the exported AIA file to thunkable2kodular.py
 3. A new file called *_kodular.aia will be created
 4. Go to Kodular and import the new AIA file
