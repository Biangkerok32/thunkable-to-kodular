# Thunkable to Kodular AIA converter

Only working on Windows

How to use:
 1. Export your project on the latest version of Thunkable
 2. Put the exported AIA file in the same folder as the converter and drag it to thunkable2kodular.cmd
 3. A new file called *_kodular.aia has been created
 4. Go to Kodular and import the new AIA file
 5. That's all. Don't hesitate to report an issue if something doesn't work.

I plan to rewrite the converter in another language (most likely in Python) because of the limitations of the Windows scripting language that truncates big AIA files.
